= Description
  A Ruby library for generating an authentication signature for Azure services.

= Installation
  gem install azure-signature

= Synopis
  require 'azure/signature'

  key = "SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ="
  url = "http://testsnapshots.blob.core.windows.net/Tables"

  sig = Azure::Signature.new(url, key)

  # Use the defaults
  p sig.signature(:table)

  # Or pass some options
  p sig.signature(:table, :auth_string => true, :date => some_date, :verb => 'PUT')

= Caveats
  For the first release only table signatures are supported (because that's
  what I happened to need). I'll add blob, file and queue in the future.

= Acknowledgements
  I borrowed the code to canonicalize resources and headers from the
  azure-sdk-for-ruby project.
